# Airbnb Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing Airbnb listing data to uncover insights, trends, and patterns in the rental market. We explore factors influencing rental prices and build predictive models for price estimation.

## Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For handling and analyzing data, including missing values and transformations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations like bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
- **Seaborn**: For creating more advanced visualizations, like heatmaps and distribution plots.

## Key Steps in the Project

### 1. Data Collection & Cleaning
We prepared the Airbnb data by handling missing values, duplicates, and unnecessary columns.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We explored the dataset to understand trends and patterns in rental prices, focusing on key factors like location, room type, and amenities.

### 3. Visualization
We visualized the data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, creating:
- Price distribution histograms
- Price vs room type box plots
- Geographical heatmaps of rental prices

### 4. Feature Engineering & Model Building
We engineered features and built predictive models for developing predictive models for price estimation.

### 5. Insights & Conclusion
We summarized key findings to help Airbnb hosts optimize their listings for better price predictions.
